## Getting Started

  

Follow these steps to get InstaCaption running on your local machine.

  

### Prerequisites

  

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

- npm, yarn, or pnpm

  

### Installation & Setup

  

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/PranavArya37/InstaCaption

cd InstaCaption

```

  

2.  **Install dependencies:**

```bash

npm install

# or

# yarn install

# or

# pnpm install

```

  

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key. You can obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

```env

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

```

  

4.  **Run the development server:**

The application uses two concurrent development servers: one for the Next.js app and one for Genkit.

  

*  **Start the Next.js development server:**

```bash

npm run dev

```

This will typically start the app on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

  

*  **Start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):**

```bash

npm run genkit:dev

# or for auto-reloading on changes

# npm run genkit:watch

```

This will start the Genkit developer UI, usually on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), where you can inspect and test your Genkit flows.

  

5.  **Open the app:**

Navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the port your Next.js app is running on) in your browser.
